# Principal_Component_Analysis_of_a_Mass-on-a-spring_System
This project focused on using Principal Component Analysis to
approximate the motion of a Mass-on-a-spring System. Data was col-
lected from the manual location of points from videos recorded of
the motion from different perspectives. After being reshaped to the
correct dimensions, the matrices were joined and the Singular Value
Decomposition of the matrix was taken. The energies of the singular
values was then examined to determine the best rank-n approximation
to be used
